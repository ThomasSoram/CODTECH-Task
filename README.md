# Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of TestNG for automating tests in a Java application. TestNG is a powerful testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit, designed to cover all categories of tests: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc.

# Features
1. Parallel Testing: Configured to run tests in parallel with a thread count of 5 for faster execution.
2. Test Organization: Includes multiple test classes to validate different aspects of the application.
3. Scalability: Easily scalable to include more tests and functionalities.

# Test Configuration
The TestNG suite is configured in testng.xml to run the following test classes in parallel:


# Test Classes
1. testNG.Login1: Tests related to the first login scenario.
2. testNG.Login2: Tests for the second login scenario.
3. testNG.Login3: Tests covering the third login scenario.
4. testNG.Login4: Additional tests for a fourth login scenario.
